            <h2>Understanding Hacking Attacks: Types, Methods, and Prevention</h2>
            <p>
            Cyberattacks have become one of the biggest threats in the digital world, 
            targeting individuals, businesses, and even governments. Hackers use various 
            techniques to exploit vulnerabilities, steal sensitive information, and disrupt systems. 
            Understanding the different types of hacking attacks can help organizations strengthen 
            their defenses and minimize risk.

            <h2>1. What is a Hacking Attack?</h2>
            <p>
            A hacking attack is an attempt by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to systems, 
            networks, or data. These attacks can be used for various purposes, including data theft,

            <h2>2. Common Types of Hacking Attacks</h2>
            <h3>A. Phishing Attacks</h3>
            <p>
            Phishing is a social engineering attack where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information, 
            such as login credentials or financial details. This is typically done through deceptive emails, fake websites, 
            or messages that appear to come from trusted sources.  
            </p>
            <p>
            **Example:** A user receives an email pretending to be from their bank, asking them to reset their password by clicking a malicious link.  

            ðŸ”¹ **How to Prevent It:**  
            âœ… Avoid clicking on suspicious links.  
            âœ… Verify the sender before responding to emails.  
            âœ… Use multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
            </p>

            <h3>B. Ransomware Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victimâ€™s files and demands a ransom payment to restore access. 
                    It spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    **Example:** The WannaCry attack in 2017 infected hundreds of thousands of computers, demanding Bitcoin payments to unlock files.  

ðŸ”¹ **How to Prevent It:**  
âœ… Regularly back up critical data.  
âœ… Keep software and operating systems updated.  
âœ… Use strong endpoint security and antivirus solutions.
                </p>
